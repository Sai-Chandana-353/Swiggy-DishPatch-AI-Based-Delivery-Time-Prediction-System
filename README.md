# Swiggy-DishPatch-AI-Based-Delivery-Time-Prediction-System
Swiggy DishPatch is a Machine Learning‚Äìpowered project that predicts food delivery time based on various real-world factors such as restaurant preparation time, rider location, traffic density, distance, weather conditions, and customer order patterns.

### üìå Overview
**Swiggy DishPatch** is an AI-powered system that predicts the **estimated delivery time (ETA)** for food orders based on factors like restaurant preparation time, traffic conditions, weather, and delivery distance.  
This helps food delivery platforms like **Swiggy** and **Zomato** enhance operational efficiency and improve customer experience.

## üß† Features
- üßπ **Data Preprocessing** ‚Äì Cleaned and transformed order data for modeling.  
- ü§ñ **Machine Learning Model** ‚Äì Used Random Forest, XGBoost, and Linear Regression for ETA prediction.  
- üå¶Ô∏è **Feature Engineering** ‚Äì Integrated distance, weather, time-of-day, and traffic parameters.  
- üñ•Ô∏è **Web Interface** ‚Äì Built using **Flask + HTML/CSS/JS** for real-time ETA prediction.  
- üìä **Visualization Dashboard** ‚Äì Plotted performance metrics and model comparisons.

## Project Execution Steps

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/Sai-Chandana-353/Swiggy-DishPatch-AI-Based-Delivery-Time-Prediction-System.git
cd Swiggy-DishPatch-AI-Based-Delivery-Time-Prediction-System

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended)
## For Windows:
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate

## For Mac/Linux:
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Install Dependencies

If you have a requirements.txt file:

pip install -r requirements.txt


If not, install common packages manually:

pip install flask pandas numpy scikit-learn xgboost

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Place Your Data & Models

data/ folder: Ensure orders.csv and traffic_data.csv are present.

models/ folder: Ensure rf_model.pkl and xgb_model.pkl exist.

static/ and templates/ folders: Should have CSS, JS, and HTML files in place.

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ Run the Flask App
python app.py


By default, Flask runs at:

http://127.0.0.1:5000


Open this URL in your browser to access the web app.

## 6Ô∏è‚É£ Interact with the App

Input order details (or sample data) in the web interface.

The app will use your ML models (rf_model.pkl or xgb_model.pkl) to predict delivery time.

Results will display on the webpage dynamically.
