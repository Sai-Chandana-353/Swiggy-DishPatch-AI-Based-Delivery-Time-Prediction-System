# Swiggy-DishPatch-AI-Based-Delivery-Time-Prediction-System
Swiggy DishPatch is a Machine Learning–powered project that predicts food delivery time based on various real-world factors such as restaurant preparation time, rider location, traffic density, distance, weather conditions, and customer order patterns.

### 📌 Overview
**Swiggy DishPatch** is an AI-powered system that predicts the **estimated delivery time (ETA)** for food orders based on factors like restaurant preparation time, traffic conditions, weather, and delivery distance.  
This helps food delivery platforms like **Swiggy** and **Zomato** enhance operational efficiency and improve customer experience.
